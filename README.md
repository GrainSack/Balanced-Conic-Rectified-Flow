## üß† Overview  
This repository corresponds to our NeurIPS 2025 paper *Balanced Conic Rectified Flow (BCRF)*.  
BCRF introduces a **balanced reflow mechanism** that integrates real-sample inversions with synthetic trajectories and employs a **conic regularization** strategy to stabilize training and improve sample quality.  
The method achieves strong generative performance while maintaining efficient sampling in low-NFE regimes.

## üß© Code Availability  
The codebase is currently being refactored for public release.  
We will provide the official implementation, pretrained checkpoints, and experiment scripts soon.

Please stay tuned ‚Äî updates will be announced here once the code is available.
